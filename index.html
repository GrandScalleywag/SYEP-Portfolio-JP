        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My hobbies are baking, swimming, rollerblading, and playing games.
           I enjoy spending time with family and hanging out with the people around me.
           I have raised multiple pets and animals and I currently have just one cat. 
           I have 2 older siblings and one younger brother. In the future I plan to explore
           many career paths and find what is best for me. As of current I am focusing on
           deciding what I want to do in life and what colleges I want to go to and I also
           am planning on building skills and gaining experience.
